# backend-api-sp21

Backend api for SP21 developer applications.

Two endpoints:
1. http://fry-kea-api.herokuapp.com/api/fry
2. http://fry-kea-api.herokuapp.com/api/kea

The "fry" endpoint returns a list of fruits, and the "kea" endpoint returns a list of furniture. Applicants need to join the two lists by combining
fruit & furniture that share the same first character.

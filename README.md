Make sure you read these instructions carefully before your start. If you have any questions
please reach out to [our email](webatberkeley@gmail.com).

To submit your project, please place your submission into a GitHub repo that is set to private. You
will be submitting your code on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). If you do not have a 
Gradescope account, please create one and if you are unable to create one, please email us
immediately. The Gradescope course code is `+++++++`. You will see two different assignments: 
`Frontend Technical Project` and `Backend Technical Project`. _Please only submit to Backend
Technical Project._ You can ignore Frontend Technical Project.

The technical project will be due at +++++++. We will be unable to respond to clarification emails sent in after +++++++, so if you have any questions about the project, please let us know before then. 


## Introduction

A company called Cats in the Sky, a cat foster home in an airplane, has just launched their services. However, the cats are refusing to stay on the airplane because they are all hungry. Cats in the Sky has tasked us to create some delicious recipes for their cats to fill their bellies & to make them happy again!

As a backend engineer, you need to create a backend service that helps match cats to their favourite vegetable. Each cat has a distinct name, and they only eat vegetable that has the same first letter. For instance, a cat named "Samarth" would only eat "Spinach" and "Squash" but not "Onion".

Here's another example of how to match a list of cats to a list of vegetable:

```
cats = ["Alex", "Abhi", "Samarth"]
veges = ["Artichoke", "Asparagus", "Onion", "Green Beans", "Squash"]

Matchings = {
  "Alex": ["Artichoke", "Asparagus"],
  "Abhi": ["Artichoke", "Asparagus"],
  "Samarth": ["Squash"],
}

```

## API Doc

To summarize, Cats in the Sky is tasking us with building an API that can do three things:
1) Return a list of matchings combining names of the cats & their favorite veges. 
2) Add a cat name / vege to the database.
3) Remove a cat name / vege from the database.

In the language of your choice, implement Fry-Kea' API! Here are more technical details to help
you with your implementation:

### Returning Every Recipe (`GET`)

The Cats in the Sky Company already keeps a list of cats and veges in their server. You can access them via sending GET request to these APIs:

1. http://cats-in-the-sky.herokuapp.com/api/cats
2. http://cats-in-the-sky.herokuapp.com/api/veges


The "cats" endpoint returns a list of cats, and the "veges" endpoint returns a list of veges. 
The Cats in the Sky Company requires you to return a **dictionary of matching** instead! which means that you need to 
join the two lists by combining cats & veges that *share the same first character*.

Here's the example again:

```
cats = ["Alex", "Abhi", "Samarth"]
veges = ["Artichoke", "Asparagus", "Onion", "Green Beans", "Squash"]

Matchings = {
  "Alex": ["Artichoke", "Asparagus"],
  "Abhi": ["Artichoke", "Asparagus"],
  "Samarth": ["Squash"],
}

```

### Adding A Cat or a Vege (`POST`)

Besides the list of cats & veges that they already have, the Cats in the Sky Company also wants to be able to add new cat / new vege easily. However, it turns out they don't have any space to store any data at all! We need to create a database for them and store all the cat / vege that they want to add.

This should be a POST endpoint that allow the users to add new cat / new vege by including the information in the post body.
For instance, if the user wants to add a cat called "Alice", they need to send a POST request with the following body:
```
{
  "cat": "Alice",
}
```

Similarly, if the user wants to add a vege, they need to send a POST request with a body containing `"vege": "name of vege"` as well.

Once the user sends a POST request, the data should be stored in a database. In the future, if the user call the "GET" endpoint again, we need to take the newly added data into account as well.

For instance:
if we have:
```
cats = ["Alex", "Abhi", "Samarth"]
veges = ["Artichoke", "Asparagus", "Onion", "Green Beans", "Squash"]
```
returned from the APIs, and the user decides to add a cat named "Oliver", then if the user send a GET request again, they should receive:

```
Matchings = {
  "Alex": ["Artichoke", "Asparagus"],
  "Abhi": ["Artichoke", "Asparagus"],
  "Samarth": ["Squash"],
  "Oliver": ["Onion"]
}
```

### Deleting a Fruit or Furniture (`DELETE`)

Finally, for the last piece of this delicious pie, we need to delete data from our hybrid
database model. For the third and final time, we chatted with our favorite Stanfurd student
about how they would approach this:

```
omg i told you already i cant even add fruits

and now you want me to delete them????
```

Thank you Stanfurd very cool. Consulting with Fry-Kea instead, you both agree that there
are too many recipes to migrate from the Stanfurd database given the project deadline and
opt instead to keeping this hybrid model to the very end. Thus you come up with the following
scheme:

- If a record from the internal database needs to be deleted, just delete it.
- If a record from the Stanfurd database needs to be deleted, _keep track of these records
and do not return them in the get request._
- If a record will be added and the recipe matches a deleted entry in the Stanfurd database,
_untrack this record and begin returning them again in the get request._

## Assumptions

There are many details that are left intentionally vague. Though you are very much welcome to
email us to ask for clarifications, we will most likely tell you to use your best judgement.
Because of this, we have provided a file called `assumptions.md` where you can type out and
voice any assumptions you made throughout this project. We also _highly_ encourage you to
write out your own documentation to this API and provide us a glimpse of your rationale
behind every design decision.
